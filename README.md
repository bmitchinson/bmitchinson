### 📌 Current Projects
- [Notion Publish Tool](https://github.com/bmitchinson/notion-publish-tool): A publishing web app for mirroring Notion posts to this website
  in an effort to make updating this site mindless. Using Svelte, Storybook, Typescript, and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/A4cBLkwvsozovIXCncPPu7/Main).
- [UrbanOS](https://github.com/UrbanOS-Public/smartcitiesdata): A combination of Elixir micro services custom built to ingest, normalize, transform, persist, and stream data from numerous sources, orchestrated via Kubernetes. My current project of the last year at Accenture Industry X.
